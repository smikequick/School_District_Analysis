## **Overview of Analysis**

### ***Purpose***

The school board of Py City wants to better understand the performance of students in the district through comparing a variety of data points to determine which schools are performing best and worst based on academic assessments. Additionally, the board wants to better understand the impacts of academic dishonesty at Thomas High School amongst 9th graders and its overall impact on the data acquired so they can uphold high standards when it comes to their testing protocols.

## **Results**

* How is the district summary affected?

Overall, there was no significant change in the district summary aside from the total number of students returned in either table. Prior to the shift in 9th grade data at Thomas High School, the overall total of students was 39,170. After the shift, that number dropped to 38,709 as illustrated in the tables below.

* How is the school summary affected?

The removal of 9th grade assessment scores at Thomas High School did not yield a drastic shift in overall percentages, with changes being miniscule at best.

* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

As noted earlier, the impact of shifting the data was minimal. Although 9th grade scores were removed from the data set, Thomas High School continues to be one of the top 5 performing schools in the district.

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

  * Math and reading scores by grade

By replacing the ninth grade reading schools with a null value, there wasn't a notable change in the overall schools performance. Additionally, by scanning across grades in each column it is clear Thomas High School maintains a relatively stable passing percentage across 10th, 11th, and 12th grade yielding little variance in the overall average.

***Reading Scores by Grade***

  * Scores by school spending

A truly fascinating note of this analysis is the individual and overall passing percentages based on spending by student. One would assume that overall spending lends itself well to higher outcomes. But the table illustrates that is not the case. Schools who spend less yield higher outcomes for students.

<br>
  * Scores by school size

Another angle to assess performance is school size. In reviewing the table below, what becomes clear is that smaller (<999) and middle sized schools (between 1000 and 2,499) tend to perform significantly better on assessments as compared to large schools (2,500+).

<br>
  * Scores by school type

Finally, when parsing out the school data by the type of school (e.g. Charter vs. District) there is a significant difference in performance. Charter schools perform well above the district when it comes to math and reading assessments as illustrated in the table below.
